<h1 align="center">Course: Uploading your project to GitHub </h1>

This repository powers the Learning Lab course [_Uploading your project to GitHub_](https://lab.github.com/githubtraining/uploading-your-project-to-github). 

Every Learning Lab course is made up of:
- a [course repository](https://github.com/githubtraining/uploading-your-local-project), and
- a template repository, but this one is special and creates an empty repository for the learner

The course repository is written in YAML and Markdown. The template repository could be written in any language that supports the learning objectives.

For more information on the goals of this course, check out the [`course-details.md`](course-details.md).
